- *Manage Products* allows you to add, delete or modify some product
- *Manage Orders* allows you to add, delete or modify some orders
- In each page the following sentences is present
```
Response code : <STATUS_CODE>, <MESSAGE>

## REST API
The term REST is used to describe any type of interface capable of transmitting data by means of the HTTP protocol.

The client will be responsible for requesting a service from the server, which will instead be responsible for providing it. 

Suppose we have to develop a web application capable of processing the four CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Our application, which will be nothing more than a PHP application, will have the task of calling, via a web API, an external service that will perform one of the CRUD operations.

Essentiually, the REST interface is all but the mapping function between HTTP and CRUD methods.

You can find this REST API in this project as class methods in the *Controller.php files.
